An end-to-end pipeline for four-class sleep apnea severity classification using EEG spectrograms from PSG recordings. YOLOv8 delivers fast, high-accuracy detection across healthy, mild, moderate, and severe cases, while ResNet64 and YOLOv5 benchmarks underscore YOLOv8â€™s streamlined architecture and superior performance.
